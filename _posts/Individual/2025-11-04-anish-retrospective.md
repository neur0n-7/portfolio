Throughout this blog, I will be reflecting on my progress and growth in CSSE 1.

# Sprints

### Sprint 1 - Tools/Machine Setup

In this sprint, we went through the steps to set up
- Kasm - for those on a Chromebook
- Mac
- Windows

At the beginning of the year, I set up Kasm, but a few weeks later, I transitioned to my personal Windows computer.

I made a blog about my experience setting up Windows and WSL [here]({{site.baseurl}}/windows-setup-blog).

In addition, our team made a Sci-Fi onboarding experience lesson, which you can view [here](https://compsciteam.github.io/student/onboarding/home). This onboarding experience contains the "KASM Setup", "Linux Filesystem Tutorial", and "Software Development Life Cycle" sections. As you finish each section, the section turns green and you get access to the next section.


### Sprint 2 - JavaScript Fundamentals Lessons

In this Sprint, the class taught each other lessons on JavaScript. My team covered the topics:

- Variables, the first lesson for the class
  - [Lesson Link](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/javascript/variables/tinkerers-lesson)
  - [Homework Link](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/javascript/variables/tinkerers-hw)
- Functions
  - [Lesson Link](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/javascript/functions/tinkerers-lesson)
  - [Homework Link](https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/javascript/functions/tinkerers-hw)

I helped make major contributions to our lessons because I made the lessons interactive with DOM. I was the main teacher for the functions lesson, and I helped with the variables lesson by making interactive demos. By adding things like DOM elements, images, and Mermaid charts, I helped make the lessons more interesting and appealing. 

For the functions lesson, I made the large majority of the lesson, popcorn hacks, and homework problems.

### Sprint 3 - Game for N@tM (Quest of Spook)

Our class made a game for Night at The Museum (N@tM) called Quest of Spook. Our team was responsible for Level 6, which was the boss fight.

**Our team made a blog reflecting on our challenges and how we organized ourselves, which you can view here: <https://pages.opencodingsociety.com/gamify/blogs/mansion6>.**

I helped contribute to the project as I was the Scrum Master for our team. I worked with my team to make the additions to the game engine (`Boss.js`, `Boomerang.js`, `FightingPlayer.js`, `Projectile.js`) that enabled the Reaper to work properly with its unique mechanics.

__How N@tM went__

N@tM was a big success for us. We recieved lots of encouraging comments, and we got three to four parents to play our boss fight level. All of them had exceptionally positive feedback. Here are two pieces of feedback:
> "wonderful game. wish i could have done better at playing it"
> "Great interactive game. Good team work!"

One person in particular was curious about the algorithms we used to do the scythe and collision detection, to which we responded that we used the Pythagorean Theorem for collision detection and [this Desmos graph](https://tinyurl.com/scythegraph) for the elliptical path of the scythe.
